Small python program to solve the word hunt game

## How to use
Run the .py file and when it asks for a prompt, enter your word hunt grid.

For the grid above, I would put in <mark>amrmeundititoeoa</mark>.

Next, it asks for the number of rows. In this example, I would put 4.
In the example below, I would put 5 as the number of rows.

Note: I couldn't find the exact word list word hunt uses so I just used one I found on github. It might contain a different set of words than word hunt's list.
